# Matplotlib-vs-Plotly
CSC510 Project for NCSU CSC. This project does some static analysis of both the libraries, compares the run-time and performance. 


Visualization is a key part of our modern day lives. We need visualizations to understand everything from
social media growth to stock market fluctuations. In Python,
Matplotlib [1] is arguably the most popular visualization library
for over a decade. But there are other alternatives. Plotly [2], for
example, besides offering visualization, has many other relevant
features. According to our understanding, there is no study
done to compare these two libraries. So, we did some rigorous
experiments to understand the code-base, the community and
the performance of these two libraries and found that although
the new functionalities of Plotly are relevant today, they come
at a cost of resource usage and complexity. On the other hand,
Matplotlib is stable, faster and simpler. We recommend that if
there are no restrictions in resources, low risk factors and greater
flexibility for learning, then one should use Plotly. Otherwise,
Matplotlib is the ideal choice.
